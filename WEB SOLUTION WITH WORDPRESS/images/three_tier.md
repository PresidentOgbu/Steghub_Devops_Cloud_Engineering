# Three Tier Architecture


## Introduction
A three-tier architecture is a well-known software architecture pattern used in designing applications, especially enterprise and web applications. It separates the system into three logical layers, each with a specific responsibility.

The Three Tiers:

- __Presentation Tier (Client Layer / User Interface):__

This is the front end of the application where users interact.

It includes web browsers, mobile apps, or desktop interfaces.

Responsible for displaying information to the user and sending user input to the application layer.

Example technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular, React, Vue, Flutter.

- __Application Tier (Logic Layer / Middle Tier):__

The core of the system where business logic is implemented.

Processes user requests, performs computations, applies rules, and interacts with the data tier.

It ensures the system follows the defined workflows.

Example technologies: Java (Spring), Python (Django/Flask), .NET, Node.js.

- __Data Tier (Database Layer / Persistence Layer):__

The backend storage system that manages application data.

Responsible for storing, retrieving, and managing data securely and efficiently.

Can be relational (SQL) or non-relational (NoSQL).

Example technologies: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle DB, MongoDB, Redis.

## Benefits of Three-Tier Architecture:

Separation of Concerns: Each layer has a distinct role, making development and maintenance easier.

Scalability: Layers can scale independently (e.g., load balancing on the app tier).

Security: Direct access to the database is avoided; all requests go through the app tier.

Flexibility: Allows replacing or upgrading technologies in one tier without affecting others.

Reusability: Business logic can serve multiple types of clients (web, mobile, APIs).
